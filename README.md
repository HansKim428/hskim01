Personal research code on derivatives valuation, financial risk management, and portfolio optimization


**Financial Risk & Derivatives Research**</br>
</br>
**Overview**</br>
</br>
This repository is a collection of personal research projects focused on derivatives valuation, financial risk management, and portfolio optimization. The goal is to explore and implement various models, simulations, and optimization techniques used in both academic and professional financial environments.</br>
</br>
Each sub-project investigates a specific topic—ranging from risk simulations and procyclicality analysis to portfolio compression and basic applications of machine learning. While most implementations are written in R, several early-stage prototypes are also provided in VBA, reflecting practical use cases in Excel-based systems.</br>
</br>
**Repository Structure**</br>
</br>
The repository consists of the following key components:</br>
</br>
**1. Derivatives Simulation & Valuation**</br>
Contains code to simulate and evaluate interest rate derivatives such as swaps. This module includes:</br>
</br>
Construction of interest rate curves</br>

Generation of future cash flows</br>

Scenario-based risk simulation (e.g., MtM, IM, ST)</br>

Efficient large-scale portfolio valuation using modular architecture</br>

**2. Procyclicality Risk Analysis**</br>
Analyzes time-series dynamics of daily risk and funding resources. Includes:</br>
</br>
Metrics and visualizations for assessing procyclicality</br>

Evaluation of how systemic risk evolves over time (boom, stable, crisis periods)</br>

**3. Portfolio Compression Techniques**</br>
Explores ways to reduce the notional size of large portfolios while preserving key risk characteristics. Features:</br>
</br>
Linear programming–based compression models (LPcomp)</br>

Offset and contract-adjustment–based models (Solocomp)</br>

Dashboards for pre- and post-compression risk analysis</br>

**4. Mini Projects: Regression & PCA**</br>
A collection of smaller, independent modules applying core financial analytics, including:</br>
</br>
Regression models testing interest rate sensitivities (based on academic literature)</br>

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction of yield curves</br>

**5. Legacy VBA Tools**</br>
Early implementations of derivative valuation and risk logic in VBA, originally designed for MS Excel. While basic, these tools reflect workflows still commonly used in practice.</br>
</br>
**Purpose**</br>
</br>
This repository is both a research archive and a technical sandbox, reflecting hands-on exploration of financial models and methods. It may be helpful to:</br>

- Students and researchers seeking practical financial modeling examples</br>

- Practitioners looking for modular, testable prototypes</br>

- Professionals exploring the intersection of finance, data, and programming
