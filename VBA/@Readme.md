**Overview**</br>
</br>
This project contains a set of VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) programs developed for the valuation and risk management of derivatives. These implementations represent earlier versions of models that were later enhanced and rewritten in R.</br>
</br>
While the VBA code is relatively basic and less refined compared to the R versions, it has been included in this repository due to the continued relevance and practical use of VBA in certain areas of the financial industry, particularly within MS Excel environments.</br>
</br>
**Purpose**</br>
</br>
These examples may serve as reference points for practitioners or learners who are working in Excel-based systems and are looking for simple, functional implementations of financial valuation and risk models.
