**Overview**</br>
</br>
This repository contains a collection of relatively short and self-contained projects focused on financial data analysis. Each project explores a specific concept or method, often inspired by academic research, and applies it to real-world financial marketsâ€”particularly the Korean market.</br>
</br>
**Examples**</br>
</br>
**1. Interest Rates Regression**</br>
This file includes various regression models designed to test the responsiveness of different market interest rates to changes in the policy rate. The models are based on regression formulas proposed by leading scholars in global academic literature, and the results reflect how those theories perform when applied to the Korean market.</br>
</br>
**2. PCA or Principal Component Analysis**</br>
This project uses PCA, a linear algebra technique, to reduce the dimensionality of interest rate curves and extract their key features. It can be considered an introductory example of applying machine learning techniques in a financial context.</br>
</br>
**Purpose**</br>
</br>
These projects serve as exploratory tools and learning modules for analyzing financial data using quantitative and statistical techniques. While individually simple, they provide insight into how advanced models and methods can be adapted to specific market environments.
