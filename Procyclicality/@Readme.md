**Overview**</br>
</br>
This project and its accompanying codebase are designed not for single-day risk analysis, but for examining the time-series behavior of daily risk simulations and the corresponding financial resources allocated in response.</br>
</br>
In particular, the framework enables analysis of procyclicality—a phenomenon where elevated market risk during crises leads to increased funding requirements for financial institutions, potentially creating a vicious cycle.</br>
</br>
Starting from the computation of various procyclicality metrics, the project also includes visualization tools to explore and interpret the results through graphs and charts.</br>
</br>
**Applications**</br>
</br>
By leveraging these modules, users can analyze how systemic risk has evolved over time—including during periods of market boom, stability, and crisis. This facilitates a deeper understanding of market dynamics and the structural vulnerabilities of financial systems over multiple years.
